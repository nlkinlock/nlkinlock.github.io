I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://gurevitchlab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jessica Gurevitch's</a> lab in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at Stony Brook University. I am broadly interested in <b>plant community ecology</b>, <b>species interactions</b>, <b>biological invasions</b>, and <b>research synthesis</b>. 

For my dissertation, I am using network approaches to quantify plant community structure, with the goal of better understanding biological invasions. To do this, I use a combination of meta-analysis, greenhouse/field experiments, and large-scale stochastic spatial simulations.
