I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://gurevitchlab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jessica Gurevitch's</a> lab in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at Stony Brook University. I am broadly interested in <b>plant community ecology</b>, <b>species interactions</b>, <b>biological invasions</b>, and <b>research synthesis</b>. 

For my dissertation, I am using network approaches to quantify plant community structure in order to understand the effect of invasive plants on communities as well as what structural characteristics make communities more easily invaded. To do this, I use a combination of meta-analysis, greenhouse/field experiments, and spatial simulations.
