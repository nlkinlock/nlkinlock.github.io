*Dissertation work*

Characterizing plant communities as networks and **combining network metrics across many communities using meta-analysis** to make generalizations about community structure with a quantitative foundation.

Estimating interactions in an old field woody plant community using large scale field and garden experiments, **comparing community-level structure and interactions among invasive and native species**.

Quantifying pairwise and three-species interactions among invasive and native woody plants in greenhouse experiments to **determine whether pairwise interactions can predict three-species interactions**.

Using spatial simulations, invading plant communities to understand **what aspects of community structure influence invasibility, as well as how invaders change community structure**.

*Other projects*

Using meta-analysis to quantify evidence and to document patterns about well-known ecological phenomena: including the **latitudinal diversity gradient** and the **correlation between native and exotic species** at many spatial scales and extents.

Designing undergraduate biology course materials that are **structured using the core concepts of AAAS Vision and Change** Undergraduate Biology Education Initiative.

Implementing a population dynamic simulation, informed by bioenergetic models, that **estimates the impacts of invasive carp on native paddlefish** in the Mississippi River.

Assessing the **potential risk of biological invasions on green roofs**, including the risk of planted invasive plants spreading from green roofs as well as the risk of invasive plants dispersing to and establishing on green roofs.

Quantifying the **diversity of macroinvertebrate communities** in small ponds within a human-dominated urban/suburban matrix, in detention ponds as well as created and natural wetlands.
