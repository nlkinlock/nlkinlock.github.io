<p><em>Meta-analysis of plant interaction networks</em></p>

<p>I characterized plant communities as networks and combined network metrics across many communities using meta-analysis to make generalizations about community structure with a quantitative foundation.</p>

<p><em>Fieldwork and greenhouse experiments of plant interactions</em></p>

<p>I conducted large scale field and garden experiments in an old field woody plant community in order to compare community-level structure and interactions among invasive and native species using network theory.</p>

<p>I also quantified pairwise and three-species interactions among invasive and native woody plants in greenhouse experiments to determine whether pairwise interactions can predict three-species interactions.</p>

<p><em>Spatial simulations of invaded plant communities</em></p>

<p>Using large, stochastic spatial lattice simulations, I am invading plant communities to understand what aspects of community structure influence invasibility, as well as how invaders change community structure. These simulations are implemented using a parallelized C++ program that I co-wrote, <a href="https://github.com/dsjamieson/ecolattice">ecolattice</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other projects</strong></p>

<p>I have led and been a part of several meta-analyses to quantify evidence and to document patterns about well-known ecological phenomena, including the latitudinal diversity gradient and the correlation between native and exotic species richness at many spatial scales and extents.</p>

<p>I’ve helped design undergraduate biology course materials that are structured using the core concepts of AAAS Vision and Change Undergraduate Biology Education Initiative. We specifically focus on pathways and transformations of matter and energy, a concept crucial for understanding current issues like climate change.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with a team designing and implementing a population dynamic simulation, informed by bioenergetic models, that estimates the impacts of invasive carp on native paddlefish in the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Colleagues and I assessed the potential risk of biological invasions on green roofs, including the risk of planted invasive plants spreading from green roofs as well as the risk of invasive plants dispersing to and establishing on green roofs.</p>

<p>I quantified the diversity of macroinvertebrate communities in small ponds within a human-dominated urban/suburban matrix, in detention ponds as well as created and natural wetlands.</p>
